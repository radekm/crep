HOW TO BUILD CREP
-----------------

You will need GHC 6.12.1.

To build a program run:

    runhaskell Setup.hs configure
    runhaskell Setup.hs build

or you can run (for installation per-user):

    runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user
    runhaskell Setup.hs build

Executable is created in "dist/build/crep" and has name "crep".

------------
HOW RUN CREP
------------

You run crep with command

    crep rules-file cpp-code-file

or with command (when you want to explicitly specify maximal length
of replaced words):

    crep -k 8192 rules-file cpp-code-file

Program' input is the file with rules "rule-file" and output is C++
code of the program which actually processes files.

-------------------------
HOW TO USE GENERATED CODE
-------------------------

You compile it:

    g++ -O2 cpp-code-file -o executable

or (no user interaction):

    g++ -O2 -DSELECT_FIRST cpp-code-file -o executable

or (context has zero length -- useful for binary files):

    g++ -O2 -DNO_CONTEXT cpp-code-file -o executable

Resulting program is run:

    executable input output

where input is file to be processed and output is resulting file
(input /= output).
